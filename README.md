## Inspiration
I wanted to build a **Decentralized Voting System using Blockchain** .The inspiration behind this project stems from a desire to revolutionize the voting process, particularly in the context of selecting the most popular state cricket team. Traditional voting systems often face challenges such as lack of transparency, susceptibility to manipulation, and centralization of control. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we aim to address these issues and create a decentralized voting system that is secure, transparent, immutable, and reliable.
 **Using blockchain, voting process can be made more secure, transparent, immutable, and reliable

## Advantages
* You can vote anytime/anywhere (During Pandemics like COVID-19 where it’s impossible to hold elections physically.
* Secure
* Immutable
* Faster
* Transparent
* Reliable


## How I built it

"A blockchain is a time-stamped decentralized series of fixed records that contains data of any size is controlled by a large network of computers that are scattered around the globe and not owned by a single organization. Every block is secured and connected with each other using hashing technology which protects it from being tempered by an unauthorized person."
* The contracts.py file contains the smart contract code and is written with the PyTeal library. In this example, a new smart contract is deployed for each new auction. And as we described in the overview, every auction needs to support creating, setting up, placing a bid, and closing out an auction. In a bit, we’ll take you through where each of these scenarios is represented in the code.
* Only the owner of the web-app can set winner and add a contest because if we gave permission to all then it's can not secure.
